# Virtual Drum

This is a project that implements a virtual drum using basic JavaScript.

## Features

- Pressing the corresponding keys "W", "A", "S", "D", "J", "K", and "L" on the keyboard will play sounds of different parts of the drum.
- Additionally, clicking on the interface buttons will trigger the corresponding sounds.
- Each key/button has an animation that is activated when pressed.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Customization
